Emotion and empathy are critical to human interaction, with emotion recognition receiving substantial attention in NLP and AI research. Benchmark datasets like IEMOCAP have enabled significant progress in analyzing emotions across modalities such as text, audio, and video. However, empathy remains relatively underexplored. The lack of well-known datasets and benchmark standards makes it a challenging domain for machine learning advancements.

This repository, **Emopathy**, is a companion to our review paper, which surveys existing work in emotion and empathy recognition. It consolidates datasets, labeling conventions, and models discussed in the paper, providing a centralized resource for researchers. By addressing the gaps in empathy-related research, **Emopathy** aims to foster further exploration and innovation in this crucial area of AI for human interaction.

---

Emotion and empathy are at the heart of human interaction, shaping how we understand and respond to one another. While emotion recognition has made significant strides in NLP and AI, driven by benchmark datasets like IEMOCAP, empathy remains underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets and benchmarks. This paper provides an integrated summary of available resources for emotion and empathy-related tasks, including datasets, labeling conventions, and SOTA models. By synthesizing these elements, we aim to bridge existing gaps, introduce SOTA AI/ML models, and discuss implications and future directions to advance AI-driven understanding of human emotions and empathy.

Emopathy is a companion repository to this review paper, designed as a centralized hub for researchers. It consolidates the datasets, models, and insights discussed in the paper, offering a practical and insightful resource for fostering innovation and exploration in emotion and empathy recognition.

## Our Approach

To curate the content, we conducted an exhaustive review of **emotion** and **empathy** datasets and related AI/ML research. Our methodology included the following steps:

1. **Database Search**  
   We leveraged reputable sources such as **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, **ProQuest**, **ACM**, **Google Scholar**, and **ACL** to gather a comprehensive collection of publications.  

2. **Boolean Filtering**  
   Advanced search queries were employed to identify relevant works published after 2014. Scripts for this process are available:  
   - [Boolean Search Scripts](https://github.com/ninackjeong/emopathy-dataset-review/tree/main/boolean-search)  
   - [ACL Filtering Script](https://github.com/ninackjeong/emopathy-dataset-review/blob/main/filtering.py)  
   - [Filtering Script for Other Databases](https://github.com/ninackjeong/emopathy-dataset-review/blob/main/filtering.py)  

3. **(Semi-)Manual Screening**  
   The results were refined by (semi-)manual screening to ensure the datasets and papers met our quality and relevance criteria.


### Findings Overview
CKJ: Update numbers after finishing final screening!

- **Emotion Datasets**: Identified **FFF** datasets spanning text, audio, and video.  
- **Empathy Datasets**: Discovered **GGG** datasets, underscoring the need for further development.
